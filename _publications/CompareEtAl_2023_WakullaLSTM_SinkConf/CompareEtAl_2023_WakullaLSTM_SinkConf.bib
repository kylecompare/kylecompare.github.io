	abstract = {Karst springs are important features in groundwater dependent ecosystems and modeling spring stage is a useful tool for resource managers. While traditional process-based methods can accommodate these complex systems, a fundamental understanding of the distribution and location of underground conduits is necessary. Alternatively, data-driven approaches do not explicitly the need to construct extensive geologic models. This study aims to implement a data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to karst spring in northern Florida. Groundwater level and surface water stage timeseries from the Northwest Florida Water Management District's monitoring network and spring discharge data of the Wakulla Springs from the USGS are used to train LSTM. We show that neural networks can easily be implemented on hydrologic monitoring networks to model karst spring stage, that this model performs best when trained on both groundwater and surface water data, and identify the monitoring stations which have the most impact on the model.},
