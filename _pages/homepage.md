## Overview
I am Physical Scientist at the USGS Idaho Waater Science Center, specializing in environmental data science and hydrological machine learning. My research interests broadly encompass:
* Groundwater-Surface Water Interactions
* Estimating Flow at Springs
* Environmental Data Science
* Hydrologic System Response to Stress. 

My doctoral research at Florida State University involved studying the complex groundwater-surface water interactions within the Woodville Karst Plain and Outstanding Florida Springs of Northern Florida
