## Overview
I am an aspiring hydrogeologist, pursuing a PhD in (Hydro)Geology from Florida State University. My research interests broadly encompass:
* Groundwater-Surface Water Interactions
* Environmental Data Science
* Complex and Changing Hydrologic Systems. 

My doctoral research involves  the complex groundwater-surface water interactions within the Woodville Karst Plain of Northern Florida. I aim to use aquatic geochemical analysis and deep learning models to better understand water flow in the Wakulla Springshed.

Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, drinking coffee, and spending time with my Carolina Dog, Raleigh.
